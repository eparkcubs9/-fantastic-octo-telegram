# X-Team NN Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
Find everyone’s strengths and weaknesses and based off everyone’s strengths we will assign them specific tasks. 
If someone is struggling with given task we will re-assign tasks in order get things done in a timely manner. 
We will also assign tasks based off of team members interests
We will let everyone know of their tasks during our meetings and everyone will be notified of changes through email. 

## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
We will keep track of any changes/progress/updates via messenger or email
We will have a google spreadsheet to use as a to-do list so we can mark what has been done and what still needs to be completed
We will meet whenever necessary in order to complete projects and help answer any questions
Have each team member send their weekly progress via message
